# A/B test results in Tableau: Analyzing Wikipediaâ€™s new search functionality

Hey there, thank you for signing up for my workshop! Here are some materials that will help you prepare.

## To Do before the workshop:

1. Install Tableau Public from [here](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/download)
2. Download the file with the dataset from this repository
3. (Optional) Read [A Practical Guide to A/B Testing by VWO](https://vwo.com/ab-testing/)
4. (Optional) Watch [Tableau training videos](https://www.tableau.com/learn/training/20211), specifically: 
  - Getting Started : Getting Started & The Tableau Interface
  - Calculations: Calculation Syntax, Intro to Table Calculations & Introduction to LOD expressions
  - Why is Tableau doing that? : Understanding Pill Types




## Case Study Background

The case was inspired by [Wikimedia Foundation Data Analyst Technical Assignment](https://github.com/wikimedia-research/Discovery-Hiring-Analyst-2016). The original dataset was transformed and adapted for the purposes of the workshop.

Today you will become part of Discovery department at Wikimedia Foundation for a day. Your team just made a big change to the [Wikipedia Search](https://www.wikipedia.org/) experience and ran an A/B test to determine whether the new version of the search is better than the old one. It is your task to analyze the data and prepare a brief explaining the results of the test.

Discovery team relies on *event logging* (EL) to track a variety of performance and usage metrics to help the team make decisions. Specifically, Discovery is interested in:

- *clickthrough rate*: the proportion of search sessions where the user clicked on one of the results displayed
- *zero results rate*: the proportion of searches that yielded 0 results

and other metrics outside the scope of this task. Event Logging uses JavaScript to asynchronously send messages (events) to Discovery servers when the user has performed specific actions. 

## Data

The dataset comes from a [tracking schema](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Schema:TestSearchSatisfaction2) that Discovery uses for assessing user satisfaction. Desktop users are randomly sampled to be anonymously tracked by this schema which uses a "I'm alive" pinging system that can be used to estimate how long users stay on the pages they visit. The dataset contains just a little more than a week of EL data.

| Column          | Value   | Description                                                                       |
|:----------------|:--------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| uuid            | string  | Universally unique identifier (UUID) for backend event handling.                  |
| timestamp       | integer | The date and time (UTC) of the event, formatted as YYYYMMDDhhmmss.                |
| session_id      | string  | A unique ID identifying individual sessions.                                      |
| group           | string  | A label ("a" or "b").                                     |
| action          | string  | Identifies in which the event was created. See below.                             |
| checkin         | integer | How many seconds the page has been open for.                                      |
| page_id         | string  | A unique identifier for correlating page visits and check-ins.                    |
| n_results       | integer | Number of hits returned to the user. Only shown for searchResultPage events.      |
| result_position | integer | The position of the visited page's link on the search engine results page (SERP). |

The following are possible values for an event's action field:

- **searchResultPage**: when a new search is performed and the user is shown a search results page.
- **visitPage**: when the user clicks a link in the results.
- **checkin**: when the user has remained on the page for a pre-specified amount of time.

This user's search query returned 7 results, they clicked on the first result, and stayed on the page between 40 and 50 seconds. (The next check-in would have happened at 50s.)
